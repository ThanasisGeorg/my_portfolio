          <p>Emakimono and kagee are considered precursors of Japanese animation.
            Emakimono was common in the eleventh century. Traveling storytellers narrated legends and anecdotes while the emakimono was unrolled from the right to left with chronological order, as a moving panorama.
            Kagee was popular during the Edo period and originated from the shadows play of China.
            Magic lanterns from the Netherlands were also popular in the eighteenth century.
            The paper play called Kamishibai surged in the twelfth century and remained popular in the street theater until the 1930s.
            Puppets of the bunraku theater and ukiyo-e prints are considered ancestors of characters of most Japanese animations.
            Finally, mangas were a heavy inspiration for anime.
            Cartoonists Kitzawa Rakuten and Okamoto Ippei used film elements in their strips.
